		"details": [
			"Implemented the iterative thresholding method for image segmentation using the Chan-Vese model in MATLAB and Python; incorporated convolution operations and region-specific information to enhance accuracy and achieve a 40% reduction in false positives",
			"Utilized the results of the operation to accurately detect objects in an image at O(N logN) complexity"
